# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project analyzes a bike-sharing dataset using **Linear Regression** to predict the demand for bike rentals based on various factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental variables. The project also explores the relationships between different variables through visualizations and statistical techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict bike demand (`cnt`), which is the total count of rental bikes, by developing a **Linear Regression** model. We also explore the correlations between the features to identify which factors most affect bike rentals. This analysis includes heatmaps, pair plots, and various regression metrics.

Key steps include:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Correlation Analysis
4. Linear Regression Model Development
5. Model Evaluation (R-squared, Mean Squared Error, VIF, etc.)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named **`day.csv`**, containing daily records of bike rentals. Key variables include:
- `temp`: Actual temperature (Celsius)
- `hum`: Humidity level
- `windspeed`: Wind speed
- `casual`: Count of casual users
- `registered`: Count of registered users
- `cnt`: Total count of rental bikes

Other variables include information about weather conditions, holidays, and working days.

## Requirements

To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> A `requirements.txt` file should also be included in the repository containing these dependencies.

### Files

- **`Bike_Sharing_LR.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook that includes code for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **`day.csv`**: The dataset file containing daily records of bike rentals.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A text file listing all the required libraries to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, explaining the project and providing instructions on how to use it.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-sharing-lr.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bike-sharing-lr
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open **`Bike_Sharing_LR.ipynb`** and run the code cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook includes visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots) to explore relationships between variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed with bike demand.
- **Linear Regression Model**: A linear regression model is built and evaluated using `scikit-learn`. The model predicts the total bike demand (`cnt`).
- **Model Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Feature Selection**: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is used to handle multicollinearity in the dataset, improving model performance.

## Results

- **Heatmaps** were generated to analyze the correlation between features under different conditions (holidays, working days, weather situations).
- **Linear Regression Model**: The model achieved an R-squared score that indicates the proportion of the variance in the bike demand explained by the model. Further improvements are possible by refining feature selection and model tuning.
- **Top Features**: Temperature, humidity, and wind speed were identified as key predictors of bike demand.
